= HOWTO: Install Family Finance. =

  # Make sure that you have installed the SQLce 3.1 on your computer. This is Microsoft's  Compact Edition of SQL Server, and is the database engine that Family Finance uses.
  # After Family Finance runs the first time it will create the database file FamilyFinanceDB.sdf. Just keep this file and FamilyFinance.exe in the same directory and all should run well.

In the future I plan on making a better installation that will put these files into an appropriate directory and make a short cut for the desktop. For now I need to focus in other areas.

If you get an error saying that you need to install a version of the .NET Framework v2.0.xxxxx, then you need to download ind install this file from Microsoft(R).
